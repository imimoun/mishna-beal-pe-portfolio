# Mishna Beal Pe Portfolio
React-Native application to learn Mishna by heart.

## Motivation
I created this project to:
- learn a new language (React-Native),
- learn mishna by heart,
- show my skills to recruiters.

## Live Deployment
Available on [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learntext](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learntext).

## Where is the source code?
Yes, the repo is empty, sorry.<br />
I want to improve this project as a business, and I can not make the code public.<br />
If you are a recruiter and you are interested in the source code, I can show it during an interview.
